This section displays two interesting concepts: Brute Force programming and approximating an inifinite value using an infinite series.

PART 1 approximates the value of Pi using an ininite series. 

PART 2 shows every possible Pythagorean Triple (of integers) using brute force programming. While this is not an efficient way to program, 
sometimes it may be useful if certain information is required by the user.
