In this file there are a few interesting applications to matrices and vectors. It displays the usefulness of array operations in C, as well 
as provides useful code for determining certain properties from certain matrices - as well as useful operations that may be performed on a given vector.

PART 1 checks to see if the matrix that was passed in is a toeplitz matrix.

PART 2 checks to see if the passed in matrix is diagonally dominant.

PART 3 is a very useful program used for dealing with sparse vectors. It can both create a deconstruct a given sparse vector, which can be extremely useful 
in applications where large amounts of vectors need to be transported efficiently.
